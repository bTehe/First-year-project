1: 
Show model in R with summary + model betas and parameters
Explain R^2 and P-values. 

2:
Residual plots + QQ-plot
Theoretical explanation about Transformations + Outliers

3:
Transformation of models. Check log(t), sqrt(t), 1/t
Residual plots + QQ-plot for transformations

4:
Remove outliers depending on cooks distance
Plot rsquared value as a function of outliers removed. 

5: 
Make lm where time is estimated log(pair), sqrt(pair), 1/pair

6.1:
There is a steeper slope for the size differences compared to status difference leading to a conclusion that size matters more.
